	<p>Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive ... The scientific theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century</p>

	<h2 id="About">Foundation</h2>
	<p>Today evolution is the foundation of all biology, so basic and all-pervasive that scientists sometimes take its importance for granted. At some level every discovery in biology and medicine rests on it, in much the same way that all terrestrial vertebrates can trace their ancestry back to the first bold fishes to explore land. Each year, researchers worldwide discover enough extraordinary findings tied to evolutionary thinking to fill a book many times as thick as all of Darwin's works put together. This year's volume might start with a proposed rearrangement of the microbes at the base of the tree of life and end with the discovery of 190-million-year-old dinosaur embryos.</p>

	<p>We have the final edition of the third year of Whewell’s Gazette the weekly #histSTM links list brining you all of the histories of science, technology and medicine that we could dig up in the furthest reaches of the Internet.

	There is a stupid saying in German that everything has an end and only the sausage has two. It is with a feeling of sadness but also one of relief that I am announcing that this is not just the final edition of year three of Whewell’s Gazette but the final edition; Whewell’s Gazette is no more.

	I am sad because Whewell’s Gazette is one hundred per cent my baby. I conceived it, I birthed it, I nurtured it and I have watched it grow and mature over one hundred and fifty six information packed issues; now I have taken the decision to kill it off.

	I actually took this decision many months ago but decided then to complete three full years before I pulled the plug and let my baby sink into cyber oblivion. Producing Whewell’s Gazette has come to consume much, in fact too much, of my life in terms of both time and effort and that is why I have a feeling of relief in letting it go</p>
